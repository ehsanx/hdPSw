### Demographic

[Demographic Variables and Sample Weights (DEMO_H)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm): The 2-year sample weights (WTINT2YR, WTMEC2YR) should be used. 15 masked variance strata and 30 masked primary sampling units (PSUs) are included in the demographics file. Each stratum has 2 PSUs.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
demo <- nhanes('DEMO_H')    # Both males and females 0 YEARS - 150 YEARS
demo1 <- demo[c("SEQN",     # Respondent sequence number
                "RIDAGEYR", # Age in years at screening

### BMI

[Body Measures (BMX_H)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/bmx_h.htm): The NHANES examination sample weights should be used to analyze the body measurement data. However, if the data is joined with data from the MEC, the MEC sample weights should be used.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
